# Image Rectification Readme

## Description

This Python script demonstrates image rectification using a set of chosen points. It includes affine rectification and metric rectification, illustrating the transformation from a projective image to an affine image and then to a metrically rectified image. The code uses NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy

- **OpenCv** is an open-source computer vision library. Install it using:
  ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
## Usage
1. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python3 lab1_skeleton.py

2. Select 4 points in the image
